 Many chess engine refer to the CCRL ratings list for their comparative performance.
Stockfish has its calibration (run against the Stach engine) anchored to CCRL 40/4, i.e. a list for time control of 4 minutes for 40 moves.

 At the time of this writing, the archived URL for the above mentioned list is:

Note that this is actually a list specified as "CCRL Blitz", which has not had the same time control historically!
 For the original early settings (actual 40/4 for the fast "blitz" time control) see:

Currently "CCRL Blitz" is set to be equivalent to 2'+1" on an Intel i7-4770K. For details, see:

 Note that, for cross-hardware comparability, the actual time control should be adjusted for processing speed of the CPU.
For this adjustment, CCRL uses Stockfish 10 as a benchmark to determine the equivalent time control for a particular machine.
