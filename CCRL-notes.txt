 Many chess engine refer to the CCRL ratings list for their comparative performance.
Stockfish has its calibration (run against the Stach engine) anchored to CCRL 40/4, i.e. a list for time control of 4 minutes for 40 moves.

 At the time of this writing, the archived URL for the above mentioned list is:
<https://web.archive.org/web/20231019032345/https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/404/>.
 CCRL's current home is <http://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/404/>.
Note that this is actually a list specified as "CCRL Blitz", which has not had the same time control historically!
 For the original early settings (actual 40/4 for the fast "blitz" time control) see:
<https://web.archive.org/web/20071228085500/http://computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/404/about.html>.

Currently "CCRL Blitz" is set to be equivalent to 2'+1" on an Intel i7-4770K. For details, see:
<https://web.archive.org/web/20230410102639/http://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/404/about.html>.

 Note that, for cross-hardware comparability, the actual time control should be adjusted for processing speed of the CPU.
For this adjustment, CCRL uses Stockfish 10 as a benchmark to determine the equivalent time control for a particular machine.
That binary is available here:

 The CCRL report pages do not disclose actual benchmark for processing speed. There are other sites for such generic data:
1. [Intel Core i7 4770K "Haswell" Benchmarks On Ubuntu Linux](^1^): This article provides a selection of CPU benchmarks against older Intel Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge CPUs along with AMD CPU/APUs¹. 

2. [OpenBenchmarking.org](^2^): This platform provides storage of Phoronix Test Suite benchmark result data, including optional system logs, etc². You can find comparisons of different hardware configurations here².

 Stockfish-specific (mostly for Ver. 14.1) data is available at <https://ipmanchess.yolasite.com/amd---intel-chess-bench.php>.
 The Intel Core i7 4770K @4.2Ghz with 4 cores and using the BMI2 instruction set achieved a benchmark score of 9,985,6501
 (according to Bing, verification is needed for the citation!).
 
 On the page <https://ipmanchess.yolasite.com/amd---intel-chess-bench.php> there are the following relevant results
 (obtained with asmFishW_2017-05-22, parameters: bench 1024 128 26):
 13.906.497	Intel Core i7 4770K @4.2Ghz	8threads	BMI2	Christian
 10.095.484	Intel Core i7 4770K @4.2Ghz	4cores	BMI2	Christian

 It is important to note that traditionally the CCRL data was collected with single CPU (1 thread) engine setup.
The same 1 thread setting has been used for calibrating the internal UCI_Elo rating for Stockfish.
Modern hardware is typically multi-core, and many recent benchmark results are from multi-threaded runs,
so extra attention should be paid for valid conditions in order to make meaningful comparisons!
